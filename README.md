# sql-challenge
mod-9
The task at hand is to research people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s, using left over CSV files  and a SQL database.  I started by using QuickDBD to get an idea of how the CSV files are related and the type of data in the columns so I would know how to establish the tables in PGADMIN 4.
Afterwards I created a database called MOD-9 within pgadmin 4, then I created a schema within the database that established the tables that will hold the CSV file data.  Then I imported the CSV data into each corresponding table. Lastly I made a file that holds the queries for the research questions at hand.
